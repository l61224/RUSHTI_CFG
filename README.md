# ‚ùìWhy RUSHT_CFG?
RUSHTI_CFG is a TM1 model that centralizes and simplifies [RushTI](https://github.com/cubewise-code/rushti) usage. It improves development, maintenance, and collaboration by managing all configurations within TM1 cubes.

- **Faster** - Define```config.ini``` and ```task.txt``` directly in TM1 cubes.
- **Centralized** - All RushTI tasks are managed in one place.
- **Maintainable** - Easily update TI parameters when parameter changes.
- **Collaborative** - Reuse and review configurations across the team.

# üìíInstallation

1. Copy all objects from the `main/` folder into your TM1 instance data directory.
2. Restart instance.

# ‚úèÔ∏èConfiguration/ Testing
1. Open cube: `Sys RushTI Parameter` and maintain following information:
>
	1)	RushTI.py Path 			(e.g. D:/DBs/RushTI_Cfg/Script/rushti.py)
	2)	RushTI Config.ini Path 		(e.g. D:/DBs/RushTI_Cfg/Script/config.ini)
   	3) 	Default Maximum RushTI Threads 	(Depends on you total available CPU)
	4) 	RushTI Task Export Folder 	(e.g. D:/DBs/RushTI_Cfg/Export/RushTI)
	5) 	Default Instance Name 		(e.g. RushTI_Cfg)
>
2. Open cube: `Sys RushTI Instance Information` and maintain following information:
>
	1)	Instance Name:	(Required: Any Instnace Name your want/ Any name possible/ sensitive)
	2)	Admin Host:	(Required: Admin host in ./instance/cfg/tm1s.cfg)
	3)	HTTP Port:	(Required: HTTPPORTNumber in ./instance/cfg/tm1s.cfg)
	4)	CAM Namespace:	(Optional)
	5)	User:		(Required)
	6)	Password:	(Required)
	7)	SSL: 		(Required)
	8)	Base64 Decode:	(Optional: Recommand to use base64 decode to avoid Special symbols in password)
>
3. Run TI: `Sys.RushTI Instance Information.Update` to update `./rushti-master/config.ini`.
4. Run TI: `Sys.RushTI Configuration.Caller` to check rushti connection (you will see some Tester processes running)

# üí™Start your first RUSHTI_CFG
1. Open cube: `Sys RushTI Configuration` and maintain following information:
##### view: `1. RushTI Default Config`
>
	1)	Mode:	NORM/ OPT	(Optional: Normal Mode/ Optimized Mode, If blank = NORM)
	2)	Max Threads: 		(Optional: If blank = Default Maximum RushTI Threads from cube: 'Sys RushTI Paramter')
	3) 	Retry Time:		(Optional: If blank = 0)
	4)	Result File Name	(Optional: If blank = rushti.csv)
>
##### view: `2.1 NORM - Process Setting` - Configure your rushti processes list
>
	1) 	InstanceName:		(Optional: If blank = Default InstanceName from cube: 'Sys RushTI Paramter')
	2)	WAIT:			(If 1 = RushTI will wait until above process completed)
	3)	ProcessName:		(Required: process name from dim: }APQ Processes)
	4)	Comment:		(Optional: leave commet for your configuration)
>
##### view: `2.2 NORM - Process Param. Configuration` - Configure your paramters by process
>	
	1) 	ParamType:
			Blank 	= Pass nothing, this will use TI default Value in prompt
			Value 	= Pass Fixed Value ( You can use <<pParam>> to replace when executing TI: 'Sys.RushTI Configuration.Caller')
			MDX	= Pass MDX ( RushTI will trigger this process per element in the MDX result set)
	2) 	ParamValue:
			Blank 	= Pass blank
			Value 	= You can use <<pParam>> to replace when executing TI: 'Sys.RushTI Configuration.Caller'
			MDX	= You can use <<pMDX>> to replace part/ whole mdx when executing TI: 'Sys.RushTI Configuration.Caller' (Do NOT USE "=" in mdx)

>
2. Run TI: `Sys.RushTI Configuration.Caller` to start your first rushti_cfg

>
	1)  	pRushTIID: 	(Required: which you configured in cube: 'Sys RushTI Configuration')
 	2) 	pParaReplace: 	(Optional: split by comma, eg. <<pParam>>:10, <<pMDX>>:{[Year].[2025]+[Year].[2026]})
  	3) 	pWaitExeCmd: 	(Optional: If blank = 0 = DO NOT WAIT, HIGHLY recommended that set 'pWaitExeCmd' = 0 when USER trigger (to avoid deadlock))
   	4) 	pSleepTime: 	(Optional (If blank = DO NOT SLEEP/ 1 = 1 second, 'pSleepTime' to let the user wait a few seconds before RushTI call the task file)
